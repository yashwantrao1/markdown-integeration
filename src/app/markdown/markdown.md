The button component is probably the most widely used element in any user interface or website as it can be used to launch an action but also to link to other pages.

Flowbite provides a large variety of styles and sizes for the button component including outlined buttons, multiple colors, sizes, buttons with icons, and more.

## Default button

Use these default button styles with multiple colors to indicate an action or link within your website.

<example>
<button type="button" className="focus:outline-none text-white bg-yellow-400 hover:bg-yellow-500 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-yellow-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 me-2 mb-2 dark:focus:ring-yellow-900">Yellow</button>
